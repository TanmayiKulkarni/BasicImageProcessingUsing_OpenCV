# BasicImageProcessingUsing_OpenCV
This program demonstrates basic image processing techniques using the OpenCV library in Python. It covers reading, displaying, saving, resizing, flipping, cropping, and converting images to different color spaces like grayscale and HSV. Additionally, it includes simple contrast enhancement to improve image visibility.

Created as a hands-on exercise to explore OpenCV functions, this project helps build foundational skills in manipulating and analyzing images programmatically. Itâ€™s ideal for beginners wanting to learn how to apply common image processing operations in Python.
